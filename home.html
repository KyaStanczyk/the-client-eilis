            <h3>Reviews from clients</h3>
            <h4>Cleo:</h4>
            <p>My hair has never been shinier and bouncier! I''m so glad I could find a stylist to work with my curly hair - special shoutout to Phoebe for her talent!</p>
            <h4>Maggie:</h4>
            <p>Terra is an increidble stylist and is extremely generous with her pricing for how great of work she does. </p>
            <h4>Bill:</h4>
            <p>After years of going to the barber shop, I thought I'd bite the bullet and try the salon my wife goes to. Jered does a phenomenal job cutting and styling my stubborn hair and specific requests.</p>
            <h4>Kylee:</h4>
            <p>After turning to black box dye, I have been worried about the integrity of my hair now that I want to go back to a lighter color. Molly and her blonding service have SAVED my hair and my confidence!</p>
            <h4>Charlie:</h4>
            <p>I brought my deaf daughter in for a haircut and the staff was extremely kind and accomodating on top of providing a service that satisfied my daughter's request. The overall environment of the salon is super welcoming - we will be returning!</p>
            <h4>Maddy:</h4>
            <p>Whenever I am stressed or want to treat myself, I also look to EILIS' spa treatments. They are so relaxing and use natural products that don't irritate my skin!</p>
